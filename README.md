# csv-normalizer

## Set up

You need to set up a virtual environment with python installed or to have python installed on your machine.

I used pyenv with Python 3.9.6 running on MacOS Catalina version 10.15.7

## To run

cd to the csv-normalizer folder

run `python normalizer.py < input_file.csv > output_file.csv`
